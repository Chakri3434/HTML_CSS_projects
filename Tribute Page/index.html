    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    Sandeep's journey started from a humble background and a tier-3 engineering college, where he faced many challenges and insecurities to achieve his dream job. After cracking IIT and working for a top US-based software company, he realized the need to help millions of students who struggle with the same issues. He quit his lucrative tech job and started GeeksforGeeks as a blog in 2008, with the intention of helping engineering students prepare for placements. Since then, he have curated and taught courses like DSA and CIP, and helped thousands of students get placed in tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and many more.
